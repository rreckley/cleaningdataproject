# Getting and Cleaning Data course project

This is the project repository for the Getting and and Cleaning data course

### Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the ability to collect, work with and clean a data set. The resultant data set produced shall adhere to the principles of tiny data that can be used for later analysis.
This project utilizes the Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data set from the University of California Irvine center for Machine Learning and Intelligent Systems.
The data repository for the project is found at 
 [UCI Machine Learning Repository: Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Data Set](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones)

### Project Deliverables
 There are two deliverables for this project: An R script named run_analysis.R and associated codebook.

The run_analysis.R script shall perform the following actions:

1. Merge the training and the test data sets to create a single data set.
2. Extract only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
3. Use descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set.
4. Appropriately label the data set with descriptive variable names.
5. Create a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject. 

The CodeBook for the project shall contain information regarding the variables and data in the generated tiny data set.
